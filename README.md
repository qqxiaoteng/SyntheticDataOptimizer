# Reason
Even if AutoML, Synthetic Data generation And Automated annotation techniques continues to develop, it is inseparable from original and excellent data, so this work requires the joint efforts of all human beings.
The most scarce task now is that after the automated annotation is completed, we need to check the improved data and add unique original and excellent data, which is an indispensable nutrient for the development of artificial intelligence technology in the direction of benefiting all mankind
